This is my first game jam, it was from KAUST and Sandsoft for 3 days. The theme for the game jam was "Time".
It was an interesting theme and a lot of ideas as my first full game in unity and I'm proud of it.
Unfortunately, I and my team made it late in the game jam but that didn't stop us to complete the game.
The design was originally made by my team member
